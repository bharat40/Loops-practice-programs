Question: Write a program in C to generate the electricity bills for 5 customers and find out the total amount paid by the all customers as per following billing plan to be paid by the customer (as per consumed units):
If consumed units are 0-200 then electricity charges are NIL.
If consumed units are 0-300 then electricity charges are Rs. 3 per unit.
If consumed units are 301-500 then electricity charges are Rs. 3 per unit for 1 to 300 units and Rs. 5 per unit for 301 to 500 units.
If consumed units are more than 500 then electricity charges are Rs. 3 per unit for 1 to 300 units, Rs. 5 per unit for 301 to 500 units and Rs. 7 per unit for 501 and above.



#include<stdio.h> // electricity bill
int main()
{
    int cr, pr, unit, amt = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=5; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter previous meter reading and current meter reading: ");
        scanf("%d %d",&pr, &cr);
        unit = cr - pr;
        if(unit<=200)
        {
            amt += 0;
        }
        else if(unit<=300)
        {
            amt = amt + (unit*3);
        }
        else if(unit<=500)
        {
            int temp = unit - 300;
            amt = amt + (300*3) + (temp*5);
        }
        else
        {
            int temp = unit - 500;
            amt = amt + (300*3) + (200*5) + (temp*7);
        }
    }
    printf("Total amount paid: %d", amt);
    return(0);
}
